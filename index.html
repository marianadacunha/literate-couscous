</figure>

<p>Porto is the second-largest city in Portugal, one of the Iberian Peninsula's major urban areas, famous for Port wine 
    and soccer team FC Porto. Porto city has a population of 287,591 and a metropolitan area with 2.3 million people 
    in an area of 2,395 km?, making it the second-largest urban area in Portugal. It is recognized as a gamma-level 
    global city by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group, the only Portuguese city besides Lisbon to be 
    recognised as a global city.</p>

<p>Located along the Douro River estuary in northern Portugal, Porto is one of the oldest European centres, and its 
    historical core was proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996. The western part of its urban area extends 
    to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. Its settlement dates back many centuries, when it was an outpost of the 
    Roman Empire. Its combined Celtic-Latin name, Portus Cale, has been referred to as the origin of the name Portugal, 
    based on transliteration and oral evolution from Latin. In Portuguese, the name of the city includes a definite 
    article: o Porto ("the port") which is where its former English name "Oporto" comes from.</p>

<p>Port wine, one of Portugal's most famous exports, is named after Porto, since the metropolitan area, and in 
    particular the cellars of Vila Nova de Gaia, were responsible for the packaging, transport, and export of 
    fortified wine. In 2014 and 2017, Porto was elected The Best European Destination by the Best European 
    Destinations Agency. Porto is on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago.</p>

<p>Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is situated on a group of 118 small 
    islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are located in the shallow Venetian 
    Lagoon, an enclosed bay that lies between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers (more exactly between the 
    Brenta and the Sile). In 2018, 260,897 people resided in the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the 
    historical city of Venice (centro storico). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the 
    Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with a total 
    population of 2.6 million.</p>

<p>Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of Masks", 
    "City of Bridges", "The Floating City", and "City of Canals". The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a 
    UNESCO World Heritage Site. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings, their architecture, and 
    artwork. Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—has 
    played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi. 
    Although the city is facing some major challenges (including financial difficulties, pollution, an excessive number 
    of tourists and problems caused by cruise ships sailing close to the buildings), Venice remains a very popular 
    tourist destination, an iconic Italian city, and has been ranked the most beautiful city in the world.</p>

<p>Córdoba is a city in Andalusia, southern Spain, and the capital of the province of Córdoba. It was a Roman 
    settlement, taken over by the Visigoths, followed by the Umayyad Caliphate in the eighth century. It became the 
    capital of a Muslim emirate, and then the Caliphate of Córdoba, which encompassed most of the Iberian Peninsula. 
    During this period, it became a center of education and learning, and by the 10th century had grown to be the 
    largest city in Europe. It was conquered by the Kingdom of Castile in 1236.</p>

<p>Today, Córdoba is still home to many notable pieces of Moorish architecture such as The Mezquita, which was named as 
    a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984 and is now a Cathedral. The UNESCO status has since been expanded to encompass 
    the whole historic centre of Córdoba. Much of this architecture, such as the Alcázar and the Roman bridge has been 
    reworked or reconstructed by the city's successive inhabitants. Córdoba has the highest summer temperatures in Spain 
    and Europe, with average high temperatures around 37 °C in July and August.</p>

<p>Rome is the capital city and a special comune of Italy (named Comune di Roma Capitale). Rome also serves as the 
    capital of the Lazio region. With 2,872,800 residents in 1,285 km², it is also the country's most populated comune. 
    It is the fourth most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. It is the centre of the 
    Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous 
    metropolitan city in Italy.</p>
<p>Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio, along the shores of the Tiber. 
    The Vatican City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, 
    the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two 
    states. Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, 
    the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.</p>
<p>Rome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its 
    archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its 
    panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent "villas" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the 
    many museums – Musei Capitolini, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and 
    contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the 
    Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. </p>

    the end of the Second World War, it has been a major centre for international politics and the home of numerous 
    international organisations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the de facto capital of the 
    European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions, including its administrative-legislative, 
    executive-political, and legislative branches (though the judicial branch is located in Luxembourg, and the
    European Parliament meets for a minority of the year in Strasbourg) and its name is sometimes used metonymically 
    to describe the EU and its institutions.</p>

<p>Brussels is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, as well as its historical and architectural landmarks; some of 
    them are registered as UNESCO World Heritage sites. Main attractions include its historic Grand Place, Manneken Pis, 
    Atomium, and cultural institutions such as La Monnaie and the Museums of Art and History. Because of its long

    Faxaflói bay. Its latitude is 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state.
    With a population of around 128,793 (and 228,231 in the Capital Region), it is the center of Iceland's cultural, 
    economic and governmental activity, and is a popular tourist destination.</p>

<p>Reykjavík is believed to be the location of the first permanent settlement in Iceland, which, according to 
    Landnámabók, was established by Ingólfr Arnarson in AD 874. Until the 19th century, there was no urban development in 
    the city location. The city was founded in 1785 as an official trading town and grew steadily over the following 
    decades, as it transformed into a regional and later national centre of commerce, population, and governmental 
    activities. It is among the cleanest, greenest, and safest cities in the world.</p>

<p>Reykjavík is famous for its weekend nightlife. Icelanders tend to go out late, so bars that look rather quiet can 
    fill up suddenly — usually after midnight on a weekend. Alcohol is expensive at bars. People tend to drink at home 
    before going out. Beer was banned in Iceland until 1 March 1989 but has since become popular among many Icelanders 
    as their alcoholic drink of choice. There are over 100 different bars and clubs in Reykjavík; most of them are 
    located on Laugavegur and its side streets. It is very common for an establishment that is a café before dinner 
    to turn into a bar in the evening.</p>

by the Kingdom of Prussia. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse, 
with half of its population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. 
A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many expatriates.</p>

<p>Frankfurt is an alpha world city and a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and

<p>Munich is the capital and most populous city of Bavaria, the second most populous German federal state. 
With a population of around 1.5 million, it is the third-largest city in Germany, after Berlin and 
Hamburg, as well as the 12th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is home 
to 6 million people. </p>

<p>The city is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance, publishing, culture, innovation, 
education, business, and tourism and enjoys a very high standard and quality of living, reaching first in 
Germany and third worldwide according to the 2018 Mercer survey, and being rated the world's most liveable 
cty by the Monocle's Quality of Life Survey 2018. Munich is a major international center of engineering, 
science, innovation, and research, exemplified by the presence of two research universities, a multitude 
of scientific institutions in the city and its surroundings, and world class technology and science 
museums like the Deutsches Museum and BMW Museum.</p>

<p>The name of the city is derived from the Old/Middle High German term Munichen, meaning "by the monks". 
It derives from the monks of the Benedictine order, who ran a monastery at the place that was later to 
become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on the city's coat of arms. The city is now home to 
major corporations like BMW, Siemens, MAN, Linde, Allianz and MunichRE.</p>

<p>Its numerous architectural attractions, sports events, exhibitions and its annual Oktoberfest attract 
considerable tourism. Munich is one of the most prosperous and fastest growing cities in Germany.

<p> Cologne is the largest city of Germany's most populous federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the fourth most 
populous city in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich. It is the largest city in the Central Franconian and 
Ripuarian dialect areas. The city's famous Cologne Cathedral is the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of 
Cologne.</p> 

<p>There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the University of Cologne, one of Europe's 
oldest and largest universities, the Technical University of Cologne, Germany's largest university of applied 
sciences, and the German Sport University Cologne, Germany's only sport university.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major trade routes 
between east and west in Europe. Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, 
with the Royal Air Force dropping 34,711 long tons of bombs on the city. The bombing reduced the population by 95%, 
mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic 
buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.</p>

<p>Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's 
    oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence started 
    somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.</p>

<p>Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port 
    of Piraeus. A center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, 
    it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of 
    its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens 
    is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural 
    life in Greece.</p>

<p>Athens is a global city and one of the biggest economic centres in southeastern Europe. It has a large financial 
    sector, and its port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe, and the second largest in the world, while 
    at the same time being the sixth busiest passenger port in Europe. The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens), 
    which actually constitutes a small administrative unit of the entire city, had a population of 664,046 (in 2011)
    within its official limits, and a land area of 38.96 km².</p>

<p>The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, 
    the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also 
    retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments. Athens is home to two 
    UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, 
    dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the 
    Hellenic Parliament and the so-called "architectural trilogy of Athens", consisting of the National Library of 
    Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Academy of Athens.</p>

    in growth among the three, and is the wealthiest among European non-capital cities. Milan is considered part of 
    the Blue Banana and one of the "Four Motors for Europe".</p>
<p>The city has been recognized as one of the world's four fashion capitals thanks to several international events 
    and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are currently among the world's 
    biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. It hosted the Universal Exposition in 1906 and 2015. The city

<p>Oslo is the economic and governmental centre of Norway. The city is also a hub of Norwegian trade, banking, industry 
    and shipping. It is an important centre for maritime industries and maritime trade in Europe. The city is home to 
    many companies within the maritime sector, some of which are among the world's largest shipping companies, 
    shipbrokers and maritime insurance brokers. Oslo is a pilot city of the Council of Europe and the European 
    Commission intercultural cities programme.</p>
<p>Oslo is considered a global city and was ranked "Beta World City" in studies carried out by the Globalization and 
    World Cities Study Group and Network in 2008. It was ranked number one in terms of quality of life among European 
    large cities in the European Cities of the Future 2012 report by fDi magazine. A survey conducted by ECA 
    International in 2011 placed Oslo as the second most expensive city in the world for living expenses after Tokyo. 
    In 2013 Oslo tied with the Australian city of Melbourne as the fourth most expensive city in the world, according to 
    the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)'s Worldwide Cost of Living study</p>
<p>Oslo is one of the most expensive cities in the world. As of 2006, it is ranked tenth according to the Worldwide 
    Cost of Living Survey provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and first according to the Economist Intelligence 
    Unit. The reason for this discrepancy is that the EIU omits certain factors from its final index calculation, most 
    notably housing. In the 2015 update of the EIU’s Worldwide Cost of Living survey, Oslo now ranks as the third most 
    expensive city in the world. Although Oslo does have the most expensive housing market in Norway, it is comparably 
    cheaper than other cities on the list in that regard. Meanwhile, prices on goods and services remain some of the 
    highest of any city.</p>

<p>Seville is a Spanish city, the capital of the autonomous community of Andalusia and the province of Seville. It is 
    situated on the lower reaches of the Guadalquivir River, in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. Seville has a 
    municipal population of about 690,000 as of 2016, and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, making it the 
    largest city in Andalusia, the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 30th most populous municipality in the European 
    Union. Its Old Town, with an area of 4 square kilometres, contains three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Alcázar 
    palace complex, the Cathedral and the General Archive of the Indies. Seville experiences high temperatures in the 
    Summer, with daily maximums routinely above 35 °C in July and August.</p>
<p>Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis. It became known as Ishbiliyya after the Muslim conquest in 712. 
    During the Muslim rule in Spain, Seville came under the jurisdiction of the Caliphate of Córdoba before becoming 
    the independent Taifa of Seville; later it was ruled by the Muslim Almoravids and the Almohads until finally being 
    incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Castile under Ferdinand III in 1248. After the discovery of the Americas, 
    Seville became one of the economic centres of the Spanish Empire as its port monopolised the trans-oceanic trade 
    and the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) wielded its power, opening a Golden Age of arts and literature. 
    In 1519, Ferdinand Magellan departed from Seville for the first circumnavigation of the Earth. Coinciding with the 
    Baroque period of European history, the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the 
    city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the 
    trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of Cádiz.</p>

<p>Brighton is a seaside town in the county of East Sussex. It is a constituent part of the city of Brighton and Hove, 
    created in 2001 from the formerly separate towns of Brighton and Hove. Brighton is located on the south coast of 
    England, positioned 47 miles south of London.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. 
    The ancient settlement of "Brighthelmstone" was documented in the Domesday Book. The town's importance grew in the 
    Middle Ages as the Old Town developed, but it languished in the early modern period, affected by foreign attacks, 
    storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved 
    road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France. The town also developed in 
    popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses.</p>
<p>Brighton's location has made it a popular destination for tourists, renowned for its diverse communities, 
    quirky shopping areas, large cultural, music and arts scene and its large LGBT population, leading to its 
    recognition as the "unofficial gay capital of the UK". Brighton attracted 7.5 million day visitors in 2015/16 
    and 4.9 million overnight visitors, and is the most popular seaside destination in the UK for overseas tourists.
    Brighton has also been called the UK's "hippest city", and "the happiest place to live in the UK".</p>

foot of the Alps, Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and the second-largest city in the 
Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region after Marseille. Nice is approximately 13 kilometres from the principality of Monaco
and 30 kilometres from the French-Italian border. Nice's airport serves as a gateway to the region. </p>

<p>The city is nicknamed Nice la Belle (Nissa La Bella in Niçard), which means Nice the Beautiful, which is also the 
title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by Menica Rondelly in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains Terra 
Amata, an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire. Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille 
founded a permanent settlement and called it Nikaia, after Nike, the goddess of victory. Through the ages, the town has 
changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. For 
centuries it was a dominion of Savoy, and was then part of France between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the
