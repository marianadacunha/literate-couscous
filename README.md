# General Info

Repository for the code of my first website ever made from scratch.</br>
This page was created by following step by step <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epDCjksKMok&list=PLHz_AreHm4dlAnJ_jJtV29RFxnPHDuk9o">this</a> tutorial made available by Gustavo Guanabara.</br> 
I've written this code in 3 weeks, in order to understand a little bit more about how HTML and CSS works (and how they interact with each other).</br> 
It's important to point it out that I've never used any of those languages before in my life.
